### The PrIM Benchmark Suite is used as small test examples.

## legion-pim
This folder contains our folder of the PrIM benchmarks ported for Legion.

## simple-pim
We have forked the SimplePIM repo; however, the folder named "simple-pim" contains a modified version of https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SimplePIM/tree/main/benchmarks. The Makefile was modified in order to have the lib folder in a central location.
